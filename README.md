# Etch A Sketch Project

This purpose of this project was to build a sketchpad.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chrome Dev Tool, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

One thing the page is definitely missing is a more appealing landing page.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.
